"""Closed meridional channel CAD solid (#13).

Generates a proper 3D solid whose hub and shroud surfaces follow the
parametric meridional channel profiles (hub_points, shroud_points) from
``generate_meridional_channel()``, rather than using a simplified fixed-
thickness approximation.

The solid is a body of revolution (axisymmetric) obtained by:
1. Tracing the shroud curve (outer wall) from inlet to outlet in the (r,z) plane.
2. Adding a thin wall outward (disk thickness = ``disk_t``).
3. Tracing back along the hub curve (inner wall).
4. Closing the profile at inlet and outlet.
5. Revolving the closed 2D polygon 360° around the Z axis.

The resulting solid represents the "impeller disk + channel walls" — correct
for STEP/IGES export to CFD meshing software.

Coordinate convention (CadQuery XZ plane):
    r → X  (radial, horizontal)
    z → Z  (axial, positive = inlet side)
